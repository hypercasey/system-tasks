# system-tasks
Various scripts for automating system tasks.

I posted a lot of my internal automation scripts here for rendundant backup, in case my city is raised to ground... yet again. Last time I lost everything, not happening this time. I made it public so "they" still know that I "know".... Yes, I'm watching "them" closely. Very... closely, in fact. Those dreams that haunt them at night? That feeling they get in the dark? Merely the absence of my light, the one thing they faught so hard to extinguish from this world. Enjoy your darkness.
